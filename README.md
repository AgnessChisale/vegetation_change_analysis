# 🌲 Vegetation Change & Forest Dynamics in Western Canada
### A Remote Sensing Analysis in R

This project investigates vegetation disturbance and forest cover change across two study areas in western Canada using freely available satellite imagery and open-source R tools. It demonstrates a full remote sensing workflow — from raw data ingestion and preprocessing through time series analysis, change detection, and interpretation.

## 🔬 Methods

### Part 1 — MODIS NDVI Time Series (Alberta)
- Loaded and parsed a 460-layer MODIS NDVI time series
- Computed pixel-wise median NDVI composite for baseline visualization
- Extracted average NDVI for two regions of interest (ROIs)
- Analyzed growing season (May–September) NDVI patterns
- Applied **BFAST Monitor** to detect structural breaks in vegetation greenness and distinguish between permanent loss and recovering disturbances

### Part 2 — Land Cover Change (BC)
- Loaded a 33-year Landsat land cover time series (12 classes)
- Reclassified land cover into a binary forested / non-forested scheme
- Computed year-on-year lagged differences to identify annual forest gain and loss pixels
- Calculated annual forest gain, loss, and net change in hectares
- Visualized temporal trends in forest area dynamics with ggplot2

## 📊 Key Results

- **ROI A (Alberta):** BFAST detected an abrupt NDVI decline around 2011 with no subsequent recovery, consistent with a stand-replacing disturbance such as wildfire or clear-cut harvesting
- **ROI B (Alberta):** A disturbance detected around 2008 was followed by a gradual NDVI increase, indicating natural vegetation recovery
- **Williams Lake (BC):** Clear cyclical patterns of forest loss (harvesting) and gain (regeneration) are visible across the 33-year record, with net forest change varying considerably year to year
